## Tasks
### 0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

### 1. Insertion sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

### 2. Selection sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

### 3. Quick sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm using the `Lomuto` partition scheme

### 4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the `Knuth sequence`

### 5. Cocktail shaker sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm

### 6. Counting sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm
- You can assume that `array` will contain only numbers >= 0

### 7. Merge sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm
- When you divide an array into two sub-arrays, the size of the left array should always be <= the size of the right array. i.e. `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` -> `{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}`
- Sort the left array before the right array

### 8. Heap sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm
- You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm

### 9. Radix sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm
- You must implement the `LSD` radix sort algorithm
- You can assume that `array` will contain only numbers `>= 0`

### 10. Bitonic sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm
- You can assume that `size` will be equal to `2^k`, where `k >= 0`

### 11. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
- You must implement the `Hoare` partition scheme.
- The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.

### 12. Dealer
Write a function that sorts a deck of cards.
